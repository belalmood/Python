Solutions- Building a predictive model of Students in their academic. 

1.Building a Feature engineering 
2.Building the model. 
3.Performance of model on unseen data set. 

Feature engineering.(Very important) 
Why We are doing feature engineering.? 
We want to capture distinguish information of student success and Failure in their academic 
and this information is feed to model learning part.
We do n't want keep all information in model learning
part(because adding noise in model part and our model performance goes down on unseen data set.) 

1.Find the correlation matrix of each feature(variable) to other features. 
2.Find the histogram of each features. 
3.Find the mean, median, variance, std, skewness of numerical features. 
4.Find the outlier of data set if exists. 
5.Find the distributions of data set of student (success vs Failure) 
6.Find the missing values in data set if exists and then fill it.(% of missing values) 
7. Create additional feature if require (Non linear features,log normal features) 
8.Select top k important features using (PCA,SVD, Autoencoder). 
9. Convert categorical feature into vector. 
10.Plot the bar chart and get insight information of student and incorporate in model building part. 
11. plot the kernel density estimation of between feature set. 


2. Building Model (Training Module.) Start with simple model and then trained on complex model. 
1. Logistic regression 
2. Naive bayesian classifier 
3. Support Vector Machne 
4. Random Forest classifer. 
5. AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) 
6. Gradient Tree Boosting 
7. XGBoost 
8. Neural network 
9. Deep learning(Apply DNN)
